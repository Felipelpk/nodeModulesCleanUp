This Github repository contains two Shell scripts that help manage node_modules folders in a root directory. The first script locates all node_modules folders in the root directory, uses the 'du' command to get the size of each folder, and sorts them by size in descending order. It then saves a text file so that a report can be generated with the information. The second script receives the text file generated by the first script and deletes all node_modules folders listed in the file. This helps keep the root directory organized and save disk space. These scripts can be useful for developers working on projects that use Node.js and need to manage many dependencies.
